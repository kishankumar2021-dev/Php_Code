Introduction to OOps:-
*****************************************
In Erliger days, in order to write the bigger bigger logic we used  two Approach to write the code ,


1.mono-lithic Approach :when we write the code , in single script inself.

2.poly-lithic Approach : when we write the entire code, as  a group of small small script then it is called as poly-lithic Approach
		1.Using Functional Approach.
		2.Using Object Oriented Approach.
		3.Using modular Approach.
	 	4.and other Approach.
		
		These All approaches for writing the code, is called as ,
		Programming Paradigam or Methodologei, or Descipline, or Technique,
		Programming Mechanism,
		
What is  Object Oriented System?
	1.It is a programming Paradigam or Mechanism for developing Software Highly Scalable Application.


Oject Oriented Programming Language:---
Any Programming Language which can proivide opps supporet , with all feature Implement by opps that language is called as OOPL.(Object oriented Programming Language)
		
		Eg : C++,Java,C#,PHP ,Python....
		
Pillars of Object Oriented Programming Language,
********************************************
1.Encapsulation
2.Data Hiding
3.Data Abstaction 
4.Abstaction
5.Inheritence
6.Has-Relationship
7.is-Relationship
8.Class and Object
9.Polymorphism
10.Dependency
11.Exeception Handling
		
After the object oriented Programming System has left its scope :it leaves some Elements as a scrap.The Elements are then Re-used and Converted into Re-useble Component are There Re-useble Component of, opps are called as design patterns 		
		
There are Total 23 design  pattern (Re-useble Components)
		Digramm
		
1.Structral
	1.Decorater
	2.Bridge
	3.Adapter
	4.Flywight
	5.Facade
	6.Composite
	7.proxy
2.Behavioural
.........
3.Creatinal

...........

These are wrriten 4 Writers and Called as Gang-of 4
		
Advantage of OOPs:--
*******************************
1.Easy to Understand 
2.Bottom to top Approach
3.Security
4.Reusability 
5.Scope and Memory Management
6.Standarisation		
		
1.Que.is php a oop language? yes over-wiev details No
2.Que.is Java a oop language? yes over-wiev details No
3.Que.is C#(.net) a oop language? yes over-wiev details No
4.Que.is C++ a Object Oriented language? yes over-wiev details No
5.Que.is smalltalk a Object Oriented language? yes over-wiev details YEs
		
Any :Programing is said to fully oops Based if it does not have primitve Datatype. and if it has then it should be on the basis of, class and object.

Basic terms of inheritence
------------------------
1.multilevel class
2.Independency
3.Depndent class (Relationship) :if any class utilies the features of any exiting ready -made class then this is called as c dependent class and it set-up  a relationship B/W both 


Questuion : How will you to sort in array
Ans :using Pre _defined Functional
1.Sort() :sorting on values  :assending order
2.rsort() : sorting on values in reverse order : desending order.

2.asort() :associative sorting on values
3.ksort (): sort the in Asending order 

4.asort() :reverse sorting on the asending order.
5.krsort():reverse sorting on associative array

Ans : Using user-defined Function

1. Has Relationship :it is logical relationship B/W one or more class .
	 this is by-defaut relationshipand class Inheritence.
	 
	 in order to achive Inheritence we need extends  Keyword.
	 
	 <child-class> will all Properties [extends] from <parents>
	 
	in order to achive Inheritence we requried ,at -least Two multi-level class.
	

   1.Parents class :This is Independent Class
   2.child-class : This is Depndent 
   
   Note :
   Parent Class :Master class,Base class,Super class,Drived Class,Father Class,Inherited Class
   
   Child Class : Sub class,inheriteng class,Driving class,son class,
   
2.Is relationship :it is Physical relationship B/W one or more class .
		this is explicit relationshipand abd called as composition /Aggregation 
	 
		in order to achive Is-relationship we need to exilipicitly make object of any class which want to use , inside one class
	 
		
		Inside function case:-
		class A{
		
		public function B(){
		
			$b = new classB();
			$b->someMethod();
		
		}
		}

Types Of Inheritence :-
***************************
1.Single-Inheritence
2.Multi-level Inheritence
3.Heirichal Inheritence
4.Multiple Inheritence
5.Hybried Inheritence
6.Cyclic Inheritence

One more the best use of Inheritence is Applied on flie Inclusion  and in laravel this Concept Is called Template Inheritence

What is file-inclusion:--
Exxtending the source code from one file another is called as file-inclusion
